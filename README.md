# BUS RESEVATION SYSTEM

This project is a Console-Based Bus Reservation System in C, designed to simulate a basic but functional ticket booking system. It allows users to log in securely, view available buses, book and cancel seats, and check current seat status. The system is fully menu-driven and operates through the terminal. It uses file handling to store booking data like passenger names and seat numbers, ensuring data persists across sessions. Key C concepts used include arrays, strings, loops, functions, and system calls for cross-platform compatibility. Itâ€™s a practical project for learning file I/O and structuring real-world applications in C.

## Functionalities Explained


| Option               | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View Bus List**    | Displays the list of available buses.                        |
| **Book Tickets**     | Allows users to choose a bus, select number of seats, assign seat numbers, and input passenger names. |
| **Cancel Booking**   | Cancels an existing ticket by entering the seat number.      |
| **Bus Status Board** | Shows current status of all seats (booked or empty) for a selected bus. |
| **Log Out**          | Exits the application.                                       |

## Files Generated Per Bus
Each bus (1 to 4) generates:
- trX.txt: Remaining seat count

- statusX.txt: Names of passengers

- numberX.txt: Seat numbers booked
Where X is the bus number.
